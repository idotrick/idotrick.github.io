JDK 10 is out since March 20, 2018. Notably for developers, local variable type inference (var reserved word) introduced
and now you would write some codes like this in Java. Much similar to Java Script!

```java
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		var countries = Set.of("Singapore","Sri Lanka", "France", "India");//Java 9 Factory for Immutable Set
		countries.forEach(Main::printFirstChar);//New in Java 8
	}

	public static void printFirstChar(String s) {
		System.out.println(s.charAt(0));
	}
}
```
