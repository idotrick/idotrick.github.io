DMS is a web based intranet system which allows the administration of different kinds of 
donations such as GIRO, add-hoc (cash or cheque) & in-kind. Because the system has been 
implemented in outdated technologies such as JSE1.4, Oracle9i, Weblogic8 etc; technical 
refreshment is suggested as the part of new maintenance agreement.

Roles and responsibilities
